Poweradmin - a web-based control panel for PowerDNS

https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/

====================================================

Poweradmin

is a friendly web-based DNS administration tool for Bert Hubert's PowerDNS server.
The interface has full support for most of the features of PowerDNS.
It has full support for all zone types ( master,  native and  slave),
for  supermasters for automatic provisioning of slave zones,
full support for IPv6 and comes with multi-language support.



SunDoctor (sun-doctor@7masters.org):

I have made some patches here for use this version of PowerAdmin with Sqlite3.
All original source comments were leaved untouched.
Look at pdns.db as working sqlite db.
